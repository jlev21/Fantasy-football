**Overview**
Currently this model predicts points per game for fantasy football wide receivers. It's trained on 2023-2024 data and used to predict 2025 PPG based on 2024 data.
See 2023 for best model, and see 2024 for predictions based on this model
**Future direction**
1. Impliment data from other years like 2022-2023, 2021-2022 to get a more comprehensive view of the data.
2. Use a similar pipeline to predict PPG for other positions
