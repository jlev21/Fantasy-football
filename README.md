## Overview
This model predicts **points per game (PPG)** for fantasy football wide receivers.  
It is trained on 2023–2024 data and used to predict 2025 PPG based on 2024 data.  

- See the **2023 folder** for the best model.  
- See the **2024 folder** for predictions generated with this model.  

## Future Directions
1. Implement data from additional seasons (e.g., 2021–2022, 2022–2023) to build a more comprehensive dataset.  
2. Extend the pipeline to predict PPG for other positions beyond wide receivers.
